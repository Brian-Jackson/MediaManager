MediaManager is modern software to manage your TV and movie library. It is designed to be a replacement for Sonarr,
Radarr, Overseer, and Jellyseer.
It supports TVDB and TMDB for metadata, supports OIDC and OAuth 2.0 for authentication and supports Prowlarr and
Jackett.
MediaManager is built first and foremost for deployment with Docker, making it easy to set up.

It also provides an API to interact with the software programmatically, allowing for automation and integration with
other services.

## Quick Start

```
   wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxdorninger/MediaManager/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yaml   
   # Edit docker-compose.yaml to set the environment variables!
   docker compose up -d
```
