# Configuration

The configuration of MediaManager is divided into backend and frontend settings, which can be set in your
`docker-compose.yml` file or in separate `.env` files.
All settings are set as environment variables, because this makes backing up the configuration easier and allows for
easier sharing/transferring of the configuration.
